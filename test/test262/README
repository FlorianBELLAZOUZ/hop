The "TEST" script shell checks the official ECMA-262-51 test suite. It
depends on:
  
  - The Hop binary $buildir/bin/testjs, compiled with "make -C $buildir/tools"
  - The ECMA-262-51 test suite which can be downloaded at:
      https://github.com/tc39/test262

To check how to run the tests:

   ./TEST --help

The BLACKLIST file contains the list of test not be executed because 
of Hop structural incompatilibities with the JavaScript standard.
