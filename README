Hop is a new programming language designed for the Web 2.0. It is a
higher-order language for programming interactive web applications
such as web agendas, web galleries, music players, etc. Hop can be
viewed as a replacement for traditional graphical toolkits. HOP is
implemented as a Web broker, i.e., a Web server that may act
indifferently as a regular Web server or Web proxy.

HOP features:

    * an extensive set of widgets for programming fancy GUIs.
    * an extensive set of libraries for:
          o handling database accesses.
          o dealing with network connections.
          o parsing wiki documents.
          o supporting various protocols such as IMAP, ICALENDAR, ...
          o supporting various formats such as EXIF, ID3, ...
          o parsing and generating XML documents.
          o ... 

HOP is available at:

  http://hop.inria.fr


To install Hop, see the INSTALL file.

Once, Hop installed, it can be tested by simply running it on a port, for
instance 8800, and then browsing the URL:

  http://localhost:8800

with any modern Web browser. We recommend Firefox 30.0 and higher but
Chrome, Konqueror, Opera 9, Safari, and Internet Explorer 7 can also
be used.
