### <tree.TREE [attributes]> ###
[:@glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark]

This is the main tree contructor. The attributes are as follows:

 * `value`: a string, the label of the tree.
 * `multiselect`: a boolean, when `true` enables multiple selection.
 * `open`: a boolean, when `true` starts open.
 * `onselect`: a listener invoked the tree is selected.
 * `onunselect`: a listener invoked the tree is unselected.
 * `onopen`: a listener invoked the tree is opened.
 * `onclose`: a listener invoked the tree is closed.
 * `iconopen`: the url of the __open__ icon.
 * `iconclose`: the url of the __close__ icon

Example:

```hopscript
<tree.tree onopen=~{alert( "tree open" )}>
  <tree.head>head</tree.head>
  <tree.body><tree.leaf>a leaf</tree.leaf></tree.body>
</tree.tree>
```

### <tree.HEAD> ###
[:@glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark]

Constructs a tree __head__, i.e., the label of the tree.

Example:

```hopscript
<tree.head class="my-class">hello</tree.head>
```

### <tree.BODY> ###
[:@glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark]

Constructs a tree __body__, i.e., the content of the tree. A tree
body is either a `tree.TREE`, a `tree.LEAF` widget or a Hop service whose
return is either a `tree.TREE` or a `tree.LEAF`.

Example:

```hopscript
<tree.head class="my-class">hello</tree.head>
```

### <tree.LEAF [attributes]> ###
[:@glyphicon glyphicon-bookmark]

Constructs a tree __leaf__. The own attributes are:

 * `value`: the __value__ of the leaf.
 * `icon`: the url of the icon.

Example:

```hopscript
<tree.leaf id="my-leaf" class="cleaf" value="/etc/passwd">passwd</tree.leaf>
```

## tree.css & tree.js ##

Default CSS tree style and client-side runtime library, should be
included in the head of the document.

```hopscript
var tree = require( 'tree' );

<html>
  <head css=${tree.css} jscript=${tree.js}/>
</html>
```
