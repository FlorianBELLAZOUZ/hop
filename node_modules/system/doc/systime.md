Syslog
======

This module implement a equivalent to the Unix `system` command. It is
a simplified alternative to the `process` module for spawning and
getting the result of an external command.

Use `require( hop.system )` or `import * from hop.system` to use it.


Functions
---------

### system.system( command ) ###
[:@glyphicon glyphicon-tag function]

Spawn process of executing `command`. Command might either be a string
or a array of strings. The result is a promise that resolves if the
execution succeeds, i.e., if its return code is `0`, and rejects 
otherwise. On resolution, the output the process has generated is the
value of the resolution. On rejection, the value is an object of two
fields:

  * `status`: the evaluation result.
  * `data`: the output (stdout and stderr) of the execution
  
  
### system.systemSync( command ) ###
[:@glyphicon glyphicon-tag function]

The synchronous, i.e. blocking, version of `system.system`. It spawns
a process of executing `command`. Command might either be a string or
a array of strings. The result is an object with two fields:

  * `status`: the evaluation result.
  * `data`: the output (stdout and stderr) of the execution
