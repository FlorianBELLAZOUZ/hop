== Building ==

To build a macosx dmg with the graphical user interface, in the root directory:

    % make -f arch/macosx/Makefile.bundle all

(don't use -j option).

In another case:

    % make -f arch/macosx/Makefile.bundle single

== Testing ==

The dmg can be tested without physical access to a Mac computer. 

   % hdiutil attach arch/macosx/hop.dmg

The command will mount the disk image for you, and then report back
it's path in the /Volumes directory. When you're done with it, either
drag it to the trash as usual, or you can type:

   % hdiutil detach /Volumes/hop

To install the package:

   % installer -pkg ./XcodeTools.mpkg -target /
