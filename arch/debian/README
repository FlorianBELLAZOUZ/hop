That directory contains the necessary scripts to build a Hop package
for Debian (dpkg). 

When the scripts are invoked under a Maemo development environnement 
they will additional build a Hop Maemo Launcher.

To run the scripts uses:

   $ REPO=<directory containing hop tarball> make -f hop<version>/arch/debian/Makefile

example:

   $ (cd /tmp; REPO=/usr/local/src make -f hop-2.2.1/arch/debian/Makefile)

This will build a hop-2.2.1_XXX.deb package in the /tmp directory.
