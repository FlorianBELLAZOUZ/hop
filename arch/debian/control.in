Description: A SDK for the Web 2.0.
 Hop is a SDK for the Web 2.0. It consists in a new higher-order 
 programming language and runtime environment containing a 
 Web broker, i.e., a Web server that may act indifferently as a 
 regular Web server or Web proxy, and an extensive set of runtime 
 libraries. The Hop language is designed for programming 
 interactive web applications such as web agendas, web galleries, 
 music players, etc. Hop can be viewed as a replacement for 
 traditional graphical toolkits.
