Q: If I run Hop once, some time passes, and I try to run it again, it gives an
   error that it cannot create the listening socket.
A: This is a know problem. The Hop apllication is just a terminal emulator
   writen as a Java Activity[1] which in turn runs the Hop server. This
   Activity's memory can be reclaimed by the Android platform to make space for
   other Activities, but the server remains running. When this happens and you
   try to recall the task/Activity, the Android Platform will rerun it, which
   will try to launch another Hop server, which fails when it tries to bind() on
   the socket the other Hop instance has. If you really want to see the output
   of Hop again, you will have to shut it down (you can use the web interface
   or just kill the process) and run it again. You might need to 'Force stop'
   the application too.

Q: If I try to run Hop in my Eclair image under the SDK's emulator it crashes.
   In the logcat I can see an error like this:

E/AndroidRuntime(  249): Caused by: java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com.android.term.Exec
E/AndroidRuntime(  249):        at java.lang.Runtime.nativeLoad(Native Method)
E/AndroidRuntime(  249):        at java.lang.Runtime.loadLibrary(Runtime.java:476)

E/AndroidRuntime(  249):        at fr.inria.hop.Exec.<clinit>(Exec.java:33)
E/AndroidRuntime(  249):        ... 16 more

A: Sorry, pal. Our Term implementation somehow clashe's with the one installed
   in the images and we haven't had time to figure it out yet. If you can help
   up tackling it, we'll surely appreciate.
