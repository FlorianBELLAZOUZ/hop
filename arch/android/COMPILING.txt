Getting stuff:
=============

Compiling Hop for Android requires several things:

 * Hop compiled for the host platform[1].
 * Bibloo compiled for the host and target platfoms.
 * The Android SDK[3], which actually you must already have if you have bigloo
   compiled for Android, and NDK[2].
 * Ant and Java 6/1.6, needed for building the .apk.

Compiling:
=========

Copy 'arch/android/config.sh.sample' into 'arch/android/config.sh' and edit it.
Also edit arch/android/local.properties to point to the correct SDK path. Then
just call this:

   ./arch/android/build-android.sh all

This will generate the file 'arch/android/bni/hop-debug.apk'

Installing:
==========

So far we've only tested using an USB cable and the USB Debugging settings on:

   ./arch/android/build-android.sh install

You can also copy the file to the SD card and install from there.

Running:
=======

The instalation creates an icon in the 'Application tab' called 'hop'. When
you run it for the first time it will run a procedure that decompresses
resource files. This can take 2 o 3 minutes (yes, minutes), but it only does
it the first time and everytime you install a new version (with new files).
Currently we're not showing any progress, so you'll only see a black screen.

Once the resources are unpacked, you'll see a blue screen. It's not a BSoD, so
don't worry. It's a terminal emulator, and it will run Hop in it. You'll see
Hop's output. Once Hop is running, fire a browser and point it to
http://localhost:8080/hop/wizard. Enter at least a password for the Admin
user (we also recommend to create a user for you), submit the form and then
shutdow Hop when told.

Once Hop is shutdown, instead of finishing the task you'll get a shell in the
terminal. We use this to do some debugging stuff. You can rerun Hop in two
ways:

 * run '/data/data/fr.inria.hop/bin/hop' from the terminal (beware, there is
   no TAB completion).
 * Force stop on the Hop app:
   * Press the home button until you reach the 'Desktop'.
   * Press the phine's 'Menu' button, then 'Settings' -> 'Applications' ->
     'Manage Applications' -> 'hop'.
   * Scroll down, press 'Force stop'.
   Restart Hop:
   * Go to the 'Apps tab' and run 'hop' again. This time it should boot very
     fast.
   * Use the browser to go to http://localhost:8080/hop/
   * You're ready to go :)
