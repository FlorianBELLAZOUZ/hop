Images are embedded inside angle brackets (,(<TT> "{{...}}")). Images
may have a title. Image title shares its syntax with links text.
It is specified after a pipe character ,(<TT> "|") in the definition
of the image. For instance, this is an image
{{,(make-file-path (hop-share-directory) "icons" "hop-16x16.png")|this is a logo}}.
