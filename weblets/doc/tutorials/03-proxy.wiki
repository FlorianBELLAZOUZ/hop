The HOP programming environment rests on a programming language and
a web server. This web server that we call the HOP server or HOP in short
is actually more than a regular server. It may act as a server and as
a proxy. That is, when a request hits a HOP server this later may decide
to respond the request by itself or it may redirect the request to another
server. In order to active this last feature, the web browsers must
be configured for using HOP as a proxy. Once this is done, HOP may be used
to implement ,(<APIREF> (<I> "weblet") "service.wiki") as demonstrated in the 
other tutorials. It might also be used to filters remote requests. This 
tutorial focuses on this last aspect of HOP.
