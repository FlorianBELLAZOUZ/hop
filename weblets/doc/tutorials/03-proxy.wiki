<doc> Proxy hacking

== Description ==

The HOP programming environment rests on a programming language
**and** a //web server//. This web server can also be configured for
being used as a //web proxy//. That is, it may act simultaneously as a
server and as a proxy. That is, when a request targeting a distant
server hits the HOP proxy it may decide to respond by itself (for
instance, when implementing caching) or it may redirect the request to
another server. In addition to being used for implementing ,(<APIREF>
(<I> "weblet") "service.wiki") as demonstrated in the other tutorials,
a HOP server might also be used to filters remote requests. This
tutorial focuses on this last aspect.

== Transforming Web sites ==

In order to illustrate the ability of HOP to filters HTTP request, we
are going to solve two different problems. The first one consists in
changing the content of a remote Web page. More precisely, we are
going to modify the famous Web site of the 
[[http://www.kernel.org|Linux kernel]] for changing all the occurrence
of the word //Linux// with //Xunil//.

~~ The ,(<APIREF> (<I> "hooking") "hooks.wiki") facilities of HOP are
at the heart of the implementation. For this particular exercice we are
only using hooks that are applied by HOP when it receives a request
for a remote server. Such hooks are installed by the means of the
++hop-http-response-remote-hook-add!++ function. That is, when HOP
intercepts a request that targets a remote server, it builds an
object of the class :http-response-remote. Then, it applies all
the remote hook to the request //and// the response. For this example,
the remote hook constructs a new response that filters the original one.

~~ This new response //wraps// the initial one. It actually contact the
remote server in order to fulfilled the initial request. It then filter
the characters responded by the remote server. These filtered characters
constitute the HOP respond.

~~ For visualizing the effect of the filtering, you should:
  - visit the web site //before// running the code.
  - you should run the following code.
  - re-visit the web site.

<example>
  (define (linux-kernel-hooking req resp)
     (with-access::http-request req (host path localhostp)
        (when (and (string=? host "www.kernel.org")
                   (substring-at? path "/" 0))
           (instantiate::http-response-filter
              (response resp)
              (bodyf (lambda (ip op s h cl)
                        (let* ((s1 (if (=elong cl #e-1)
                                       (read-string ip)
                                       (read-chars (elong->fixnum cl) ip)))
                               (s2 (pregexp-replace* "Linux" s1 "<span style='color: red'>Xunil</span>")))
                           (display s2 op)
                           (flush-output-port op))))))))

  (hop-http-response-remote-hook-add!
   (lambda (req resp)
      (or (linux-kernel-hooking req resp)
          resp)))

  (<HTML>
     (<BODY> "Remote hooking is now registered!")
     (<BR>)
     (<BR>)
     (<A> :href "http://www.kernel.org" "http://www.kernel.org"))
</example>

The first part of the source code define the hook. As all hooks, it
is implemented by a function of two arguments: the initial request and
the respond built to fulfilled it. This hook checks that the destination
if the URL of the Linux kernel Web site. For that it checks if the
host of the request is ++www.kernel.org++. Then it checks if the path
of the request is actually the path of the main Linux kernel page (the
++/++ path). If one of these two conditions is not meet, the original
respond is returned. Otherwise, a new response, an instance of
the ::http-response-filter is built and returned. That filter executes
the initial request and then, using regular expressions, it replace
all the occurrences of the word //Linux// with //Xunil//.


== Avoiding bouncing ==

This second example rests on the HOP ,(<APIREF> (<I> "filtering")
"filters.wiki") facility. When a request is received, filters are used
for to determine if it can be handled locally or if it has to be
transmitted to a remote server. Filters are registered by the means of
the ++hop-filter-add!++ function.

~~ In this particular example, we teach HOP how to intercept some
requests sent to Google. More precisely, requests emitted when a user
clicks on a result provided by Google are intercepted. Frequently
these links do not directly point to the web site referenced to by
Google. Instead, they point to the Google web site that re-directs
the client to the correct URL. In order to avoid this useless indirection,
a simple filter can isolate such Google indirection.

~~ Let us assume that Google find that the url
[[http://www.kernel.org]] satisfies your request. Instead of producing
a page that contains a direct link to that URL, it will provide a page
with a link to: [[http://www.google.com/url?q=http://www.kernel.org/]]
Hence when the user click on that link, it first goes to the Google web
site. That site, redirects the user to the actual destination. 

<example>
  (hop-filter-add!
   (lambda (req)
      (with-access::http-request req (host path)
         (when (and (string=? host "www.google.com")
                    (substring-at? path "/url" 0))
            (let ((q (cgi-fetch-arg "q" path)))
               (when q
                  (instantiate::http-response-string
                     (start-line "HTTP/1.0 301 Moved Permanently")
                     (header (list (cons 'location: q))))))))))
</example>

This filter first check if the host referenced to in the request is
++www.google.com++. If it is, it then check if the path of the request
is ++/url++ and if that request is augmented with a 
parameter ++q++. For that, it uses the function ++cgi-fetch-arg++ of
the HOP standard api. In such a case, it redirect the client to
the final destination.
