<doc> Delayed executions

== Description ==

The ++<DELAY>++ markup delay the execution of a function. It is
generally deployed when one has to implement a page with a content
that has to be updated over the time. For instance, each time a
container exposes its content. The ++<DELAY>++ markup is supposed to
be used in conjunction of container markups such as ++<NOTEPAD>++s,
++<TREE>++s, ++<FL>++ss, or ++<TABSLIDER>++s.

The ++body++ of the delayed execution is a //thunk//. That is a procedure
accepting no parameter. This procedure is executed once, when the object
is to be displayed.
