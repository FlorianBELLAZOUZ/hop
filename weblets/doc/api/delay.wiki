<doc> Delayed executions

== Description ==

The ++<DELAY>++ markup delays the execution of a function. It **must**
be embedded inside a container. It is an error to use a ++<DELAY>++
markup outside a container that explicitly supports delayed trees. The
++<DELAY>++ markup is supposed to be used in conjunction of container
markups such as ++<NOTEPAD>++s, ++<TREE>++s, ++<FL>++ss, or
++<TABSLIDER>++s.

The ++body++ of the delayed execution is a //thunk//. That is a procedure
accepting no parameter. This procedure is executed, when the object
is to be displayed.
