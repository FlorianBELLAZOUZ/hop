<doc> Delayed executions

== Description ==

The ++<DELAY>++ markup delays the execution of a function. In general
it is used in conjunction of container markups such as ++<NOTEPAD>++s,
++<TREE>++s, ++<FL>++ss, or ++<TABSLIDER>++s. The ++<DELAY>++ markup
delay its execution until the time it has to be served to a client.
That is, when the broker constructs a HTML tree, it does not evaluated
the ++<DELAY>++ nodes. It defers this evaluation until the node is
actually needed for responding to the client.

The ++body++ of the delayed execution is a //thunk//. That is a procedure
accepting no parameter. This procedure is executed, when the object
is to be displayed.
