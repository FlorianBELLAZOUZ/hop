<doc> SHA1 checksum

== Description ==
Compute the SHA1 checksum of a string.


== Synopsis ==

=== Server & Client ===

  (sha1sum obj)
  (sha1sum-string string)


=== Requirements ===

Client code using //SHA1// facilities needs to load the script
++sha1.js++. Hence, documents using //SHA1// must include in their
header, the following statement:

  (<HEAD> :include "sha1")


== Server & Client Definitions ==

=== ++(sha1sum obj)++ ===
<procedure> sha1sum
<function> sha1sum

<arguments>
^  arguments  ^   type   ^   description                                   ^
| obj         |    _     | The object for which the checksum is computed.    |
</arguments>

The function ++sha1sum++ dispatches over its argument and invokes the
ad-hoc function. On the client-side this function can only be passed
//strings// arguments. On the server-side, it can be passed
//string//, //input ports//, or //mmap// (memory mapped area).
</function>
</procedure>

=== ++(sha1sum-string string)++ ===
<procedure> sha1sum-string
<function> sha1sum-string

<arguments>
^  arguments  ^   type   ^   description                                   ^
| string      |  string  | The string for which the checksum is computed.    |
</arguments>

Compute the SHA1 checksum of the //string//.
</function>
</procedure>
