== Description ==

These functions parses file according to the HOP syntax.

== Synopsis ==

  (hop-read [input-port])
  (hop-load path [:env] [:mode])
  (hop-load-once path [:env])
  (hop-load-modified path [:env])
  (hop-load-unmark! path)
  (the-loading-file)
  (the-loading-dir)
  
== Examples ==

<example>hop-read, hop-load, the-loading-file, the-loading-dir</example>

== Server Definitions ==
<server>

=== ++(hop-read [port])++ ===
<function> hop-read

<arguments>
^  arguments  ^   type      ^  short description          ^
| port        | input-port  | the input port.             |
</arguments>
</function>

The function ++hop-read++ reads an entire expression from an input port.

=== ++(hop-load path [:env] [:mode])++ ===
<function> hop-load

<arguments>
^  arguments  ^   type   ^  short description           ^
| path        |  string  | the file name to be loaded.  |
| env         |  module  | the eval environment.        |
| mode        |  symbol  | the load mode.               |
</arguments>

This function loads the file ++path++. That is, it reads and evaluates
all the expressions. The expressions are evaluated in the environment
++env++. By default the current module's environment is used.

The parameter ++mode++ specifies the loading mode. The --load--
mode evaluates all the loaded expressions and forces ++hop-load++ to
only return the value produced by evaluated the last expression.
The --include-- load mode returns a list of all evaluations.

The function ++hop-load++ is thread safe. No more than one thread
can simultaneously reads a single file.
</function>

=== ++(hop-load-once path [:env])++ ===
<function> hop-load-once

<arguments>
^  arguments  ^   type   ^  short description           ^
| path        |  string  | the file name to be loaded.  |
| env         |  module  | the eval environment.        |
</arguments>

As ++hop-load++ it loads a file in the ++env++ environment. By contrast
with ++hop-load++ it does not return any value. Hence, ++hop-load-once++
can only be used for its effects.

Invoking ++hop-load-once++ with a parameter ++path++ loads the file in
memory //if not already loaded//. That is, if the file ++path++ is loaded
//if and only if// it has not already been loaded with ++hop-load-once++.

This function is thread safe.
</function>

=== ++(hop-load-modified path [:env])++ ===
<function> hop-load-modified

<arguments>
^  arguments  ^   type   ^  short description           ^
| path        |  string  | the file name to be loaded.  |
| env         |  module  | the eval environment.        |
</arguments>

As ++hop-load-once++ but in addition, the file is reloaded if the file
has changed on the disc since it has been loaded.
</function>

=== ++(hop-load-once-unmark! path)++ ===
<function> hop-load-once-unmark!
Unmarks ++path++. The next evaluation of ++(hop-load-once path)++
reloads the file ++path++.
</function>

=== ++(the-loading-file)++ ===
<function> the-loading-file

This function returns the name of the file currently being loaded.

</function>

=== ++(the-loading-dir)++ ===
<function> the-loading-dir

This function returns the dirname of the file currently being loaded.

</function>
