<doc> File chooser

== Description ==

The markup ++<FILECHOOSER>++ implements a //File selector// in HOP
documents. This markup can be used in replacement for a ++<INPUT>++ 
markup. 

== Synopsis ==

=== Server and Clients ===

  (<FILECHOOSER> arg ...)


=== Requirements ===

Client codes using //File browsers// need to load the script
++hop-file.js++ and ++hop-paned.js++. They also need to load the
++hop-file.hss++, ++hop-paned.hss++. Hence, documents using //File
browsers// must include in their header, the following statement:


  (<HEAD> :include "hop-file" "hop-paned")


~~ Note: The ++FILECHOOSER++ which has been introduced in Hop 1.9.x
replaces the old markup ++FILESELECTOR++ and the function
++fileselect++. The new markup subsumes these old facilities
since it can be used in server //and// client code.

</arguments>

The markup ++<FILECHOOSER>++ creates a widget for selecting files. It lets
users browsing a file system located either of the server or on a Webdav
server. When a lightweight widget is wanted for selected files, the
++<INPUT>++ markup with the type set to ++url++ can be preferred.

The argument :url specifies the initial value for the file chooser.

The argument :filters specifies a list of file filters. Each filter is
a list of two elements: a filter name and a regular expression. By defaults
the following filter list is used:

  '(("All Files" "^[^.].*"))


The argument :hidden controls whether private files (e.g., files starting with
a . character) are by default displayed or not.
