<doc> HZ -- Hop weblets manager

== Description ==

[[hz|HZ]] manages Hop weblets //installation//, //update//, and //removal//. 
It operates installation across the web.

== Making a weblet available to others ==

The tutorial ,(<TUTORIALREF> "Releasing a HZ package" "06-hz.wiki")
presents how to construct and release a package suitable for HZ.
Please refer to this documentation page.

== User Services ==

HZ defines several services:

  - ++[[hz]]++: This is the main entry point for HZ. It shows a
 graphical user interface that lets user update their system (i.e., make
 it in sync with the remote global Hop weblets server).
  - ++[[hz/preferences]]++: Lets user customize HZ.
  - ++hz/install-ondemand++: This lets users install weblet not registered
 in the global remote HZ repository. It service takes two arguments:
   - ++name++, the name of the weblet
   - ++url++, the url (that could use the ++file://++ syntax) specifying the
 location of the weblet. 
  - ++hz/list++: Produce a HTML page displaying all the available weblets.


== Administration Services ==

HZ can be administrated (packages managed) with the following services:

  - ++[[hz/repository]]++. This service requires administration rights. This
 service update or create a HZ database. In particular, this system must be
 used to initialize the HZ database.
  - ++[[hz/upload]]++. This service requires administration rights. It allows
 a contributor which is granted administration rights to upload a new package 
 onto the server disk. The service updates the HZ database automatically.
 Adding a package can be also be done //manually//. It only requires to 
 copy the ++.hz++ file in its dedicated directory on the disk of the server
 running ++[[hz]]++ and to proceed to an //update// via the 
 ++[[hz/repository]]++ service.


=== Package file name ===

The name of the files holding HZ package must **strictly** conform
rules enforced by the system. A badly formed HZ package file name cannot
be added into the HZ database. The language defining the HZ package file
named is defined by the following regular expression:

  (.*)-[0-9]+[.][0-9]+(?:[.][0-9]+)?(?:-(?:r|rc|pre)[0-9]+)?.hz


Here is a list of example of correct HZ file names:

  hoptris-1.0.hz
  hop_tris-1.0.hz
  hopslide-1.4.0-rc2.hz


It should be noted that hyphen can only used in HZ package for separating
the base name of the package and its version number.

== Installing weblets ==

Weblets most often should be installed using the GUI implemented by the
++[[hz]]++ service. Using the tool ++hopsh++, weblets can also be installed
using the URL of the package. For instance, 

  hopsh -c "hz/install-ondemand -name hoptris -url http://foo.nowehere.org/hoptris-1.0.hz"


installs the weblet hoptris-1.0.hz on the local host, provided that HOP 
is running on port 8080.
