~~ HopSh reads expressions from the console. 

  * Expressions started with a parenthesis (character ++(++) are sent to 
 a Hop broker for being evaluated. The result of this evaluation is displayed 
 on the console.
  * Expression not staring with a parenthesis are interpreted as 
 ++service++ invocation. The arguments are denoted by a dash character.
 For instance, the following HopSh command invokes the Hop service
 ++foo++ which accepts two parameters: ++file++ and ++dir++:

  > foo -file gee.hop -dir /tmp


 The same result could be accomplised with the following shell command:

  $ hopsh -c foo -file gee.hop -dir /tmp


== Command line options ==

HopSh accept various command line options:
