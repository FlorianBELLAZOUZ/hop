== Install and run @HZ@ ==

  - Download and install [[http://hop.inria.fr|Hop]] (the impatients can use 
 the pre-compiled JVM version, although it is significantly slower than the 
 native version).
  - Click the ++Install/Update++ button above (or the ++Run++ if you only
 want to give @HZ@ a try).
