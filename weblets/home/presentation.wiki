== Presentation ==

Hop is a new programming language designed for the Web 2.0.  It is a
higher-order language for programming interactive web applications
such as web agendas, web galleries, music players, etc. Hop can be
viewed as a replacement for traditional graphical toolkits. HOP is
implemented as a **Web broker**, //i.e.//, a Web server that may act
indifferently as a regular Web server or Web proxy.

~~ HOP features:

  * an extensive set of widgets for programming fancy GUIs.
  * an extensive set of libraries for:
    * handling //database// accesses.
    * dealing with //network// connections.
    * parsing //wiki// documents.
    * supporting various protocols such as IMAP, ICALENDAR, ...
    * supporting various formats such as EXIF, ID3, ...
    * parsing and generating //XML// documents.
    * ...



~~ This whole Web page is implemented in HOP so in addition
to spreading HOP to the Web, it also serves as a //meta-demonstration//.

== Release information ==

~~ The current stable HOP version is **,(<SPAN> :style "color: red" (home-hop-stable-version))**.

~~ This unstable version only runs on platforms running the **Linux** 
operating system. Next versions will run on various platforms.

~~ The pages generated by HOP are compatible with browsers compliant
with [[http://www.w3c.org|W3C]] and
[[http://www.ecma-international.org/|ECMA]] standards. That is, they
are operational with [[http://www.mozilla.com/|Firefox]],
[[http://www.mozilla.com/|Mozilla]],
[[http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/safari|Safari]],
[[http://www.konqueror.org|Konqueror]], and
[[http://www.opera.com|Opera]]. On the other hand, they cannot be
visualized with Internet Explorer version 5 and 6. We hope that IE
version 7 will improve the situation.


== Requirement ==

The [[http://www.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Bigloo|Bigloo]] compiler is the only
strict requirement to install HOP. However, most weblets (Hop applications)
use [[http://www.sqlite.org|SQLite]] for managing databases. Hence, it
is recommended to install it prior to Bigloo.
