~~ HOP is a Software Development Kit for the Web 2.0 and the so-called
//diffuse// Web. It relies a new higher-order language for
programming interactive web applications such as //multimedia//
applications (web galleries, music players, ...), //office//
applications (web agendas, mail clients, ...), ubiquitous domotics,
etc. HOP can be viewed as a replacement for traditional graphical
toolkits. HOP is implemented as a **Web broker**, //i.e.//, a Web
server that may act indifferently as a regular Web server or Web
proxy.

~~ HOP features:

  * an extensive set of ,(<SPAN> :class "feature" "widgets") 
 for programming fancy and portable Web GUIs,
  * HTML5 support,
  * a versatile ,(<SPAN> :class "feature" "Web server") supporting HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1,
  * an optimizing ,(<SPAN> :class "feature" "native code compiler") for server code,
  * an on-the-fly ,(<SPAN> :class "feature" "Javascript compiler") for client code,
  * a native ,(<SPAN> :class "feature" "multimedia") support for enabling ubiquitous
 Web multimedia applications.
  * fast ,(<SPAN> :class "feature" "WebDAV") level 1 support,
  * an extensive set of ,(<SPAN> :class "feature" "libraries") for the mail, calendars,
 databases, Web technologies, ...


~~ This whole Web page is implemented in HOP so in addition
to spreading HOP to the Web, it also serves as a //meta-demonstration//.


== Release information ==

~~ The current stable HOP version is **,(<SPAN> :style "color: red" (home-hop-stable-version))**.

~~ The native version (built from the source) of the broker runs on most **Linux**
platforms. In addition to **x86/32** and **x86/64** architectures, it has
been successfully installed on **PowerPC G3** (Synology DS-101) and **Arm** (Maemo4, Maemo5
Lincon i8000). The native version also runs on **MacOS X**.

~~ The pages generated by HOP are compatible with browsers compliant
with [[http://www.w3c.org|W3C]] and
[[http://www.ecma-international.org/|ECMA]] standards. That is, they
are operational with [[http://www.mozilla.com/|Firefox]],

The [[http://www-sop.inria.fr/indes/fp/Bigloo|Bigloo]] compiler is the only
strict requirement for HOP.
