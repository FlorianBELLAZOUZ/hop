== Presentation ==

Hop is a new programming language designed for the Web 2.0.  It is a
higher-order language for programming interactive web applications
such as web agendas, web galleries, music players, etc. Hop can be
viewed as a replacement for traditional graphical toolkits. HOP is
implemented as a **Web broker**, //i.e.//, a Web server that may act
indifferently as a regular Web server or Web proxy.
