== Presentation ==

HOP is a programming language designed for programming interactive Web
applications. HOP is a stratified programming language. One stratum is
intended for programming //server-side// computations. The other one
is intended for programming //client-side// computations. HOP is
implemented as a **Web broker**, //i.e.//, a Web server that may act
indifferently as a regular Web server or a Web proxy. 

~~ HOP features:

  * an extensive set of widgets for programming fancy GUIS.
  * an extensive set of libraries for:
    * handling //database// accesses.
    * dealing with //network// connections.
    * parsing //wiki// documents.
    * supporting various protocols such as IMAP, ICALENDAR, ...
    * parsing and generating //XML// documents.
    * ...



~~ This whole Web page is implemented in HOP so in addition
to spreading HOP to the Web, it also serves as a //meta-demonstration//.

== Release information ==

~~ The current HOP version is **,(<SPAN> :style "color: red" (hop-version))**.

~~ It can run on any platform that supports a complete **Java SDK 1.4**. 
For better performance, it can run in native mode on
platforms running the **Linux** operating system.

~~ The pages generated by HOP are incompatible with Internet
Explorer. They are lame with Safari, Konqueror, and Opera. They are
only fully operational with **Firefox** and **Mozilla**. This will be fixed
for the first stable version.

== Requirements ==

HOP is bootstrapped using the [[http://www.inria.fr/mimosa/fp/Bigloo|Bigloo]]
compiler. So, in order to install HOP, Bigloo has to be installed first.
This is the only requirement for HOP.
