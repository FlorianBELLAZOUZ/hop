== Presentation ==

Hop is a new higher-order language designed for programming
interactive web applications such as web agendas, web galleries, music
players, etc. In addition to enabling programming distributed
applications over the web, Hop is also convenient for implementing
applications that run on a single computer, on behalf of a single
user. In that particular case, Hop can be considered as a replacement
for traditional graphical toolkits. HOP is implemented as a **Web
broker**, //i.e.//, a Web server that may act indifferently as a
regular Web server or a Web proxy.

~~ HOP features:

  * an extensive set of widgets for programming fancy GUIS.
  * an extensive set of libraries for:
    * handling //database// accesses.
    * dealing with //network// connections.
    * parsing //wiki// documents.
    * supporting various protocols such as IMAP, ICALENDAR, ...
    * supporting various formats such as EXIF, ID3, ...
    * parsing and generating //XML// documents.
    * ...



~~ This whole Web page is implemented in HOP so in addition
to spreading HOP to the Web, it also serves as a //meta-demonstration//.

== Release information ==

~~ The current stable HOP version is **,(<SPAN> :style "color: red" (home-hop-stable-version))**.

~~ This unstable version only runs on platforms running the **Linux** 
operating system. Next versions will run on various platforms.

[[http://www.konqueror.org|Konqueror]], and
[[http://www.opera.com|Opera]]. They are only fully operational with
[[http://www.mozilla.com/|Firefox]] and

stable version.

compiler. So, in order to install HOP, Bigloo has to be installed first.
This is the only requirement for HOP.
