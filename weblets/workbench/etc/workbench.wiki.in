~~ The workbench reads a program on the disk of the broker, executes
it, and includes it's generated content inside a window of the browser
and report possible errors or messages.

~~ The workbench top row consists of a file selector. Hitting the ++[tab]++
key complements the file path prefix. Hitting ++[tab]++ twice pops up a
file brower. Hitting the ++[return]++ loads the program.

~~ Once loaded, a program may be executed. For that, the second input row
of the workbench must be filled with the name of the service to be executed.
Click the ++run++ button or hitting the ++[return]++ key of the service
input field spawns the execution.
