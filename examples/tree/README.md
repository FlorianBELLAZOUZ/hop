This example shows how to use Hop `tree`s. This example uses a
_dynamic_ tree, that is a tree whose content is computed when
unfold. This is achieved by specifying a Hop service that is
automatically invoked when the tree unfolds.

The example also shows how to use client-side functions that
control the state of the tree.
