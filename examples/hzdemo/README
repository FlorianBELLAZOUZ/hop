hzdemo.js
This weblet demonstrates basic use of hz API to trigger the download and 
installation of a weblet to a target machine.

The demo runs two web servers.
The first server (on port 9999) is in charge of delivering the weblet to 
the client. In the real life, this server will be the store front end, 
but for the purpose of the demo, run it on the local machine.

launch hop -p 9999

The second server (on any port, 8080 is fine) is in charge of handling 
user requests (web interface), downloading and installing the weblet from 
the store server.

launch hop hzdemo.js

then launch a web client and invoke the following url
http://localhost:8080/hop/hzdemo

The url of the weblet to download is pre-computed (to have an example that 
just works). 
Click install and the "foo" weblet will be downloaded from the 9999 server, 
then stored in the hz download area, then installed in the weblet area.

The hz area is in ~/.config/hop/hz
There is a database called hz.db, and a download subdir containing the 
downloaded .hz files

The weblet installation area is in ~/.config/hop/weblets
This is the place were the weblets are installed.

Go to these directories and check that the weblet has been downloaded 
and installed.
Replay the example by first deleting files in the .config/hop/hz and 
.config/hop/weblets directories then installing them again.
You may alternatively use the standard (and more sophisticated) hop/hz service 
(invoked from your browser) to browse the local hz database, reset the cache, 
install/uninstall a weblet.

Other features of the hop/hz-demo service :

The search button browses the database (regular expression search)
The find button selects a weblet (exact match)
