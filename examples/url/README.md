This illustrates how Hop services can be mixed with remote Web services
to build complex applications.

This example uses a named Hop service (`url`) and an anonymous Hop service
(the `translate` variable). A Web service is built (`mymemory`) which is
used as a regular Hop service although it is implemented by a regular
Web server unaware of Hop.
